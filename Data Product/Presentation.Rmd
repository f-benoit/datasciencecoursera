## Instruction

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.



## Plot a best fit line on 3 polynomial model
**Description**   
This application allows you to generate a 3 polynomial model with a customizable sample size 
You can then plot a simple regression line or a more complex line going up to 10 degrees
The aim of this app is to show the effect of complex polynomial and data size on overfitting 


## Example of a regression Line
```{r ,echo=TRUE}
n <- 50
x <- sort(runif(n, -2, 2))
y <- 3*x^3 + 5*x^2 + 0.5*x + 20 # a 3 polynomial model
err <- rnorm(n, sd=3)
ye <- y + err
df <- data.frame(x, ye)
{plot(ye~x, df, ylab="y")
fit <- lm(ye ~ poly(x, degree=1), data=df)
newdat <- data.frame(x=seq(min(df$x), max(df$x),100))
lines(newdat$x, predict(fit, newdat))
}

```
